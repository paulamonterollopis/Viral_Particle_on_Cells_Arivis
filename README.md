# Purpose of this repository

This repository contains two custom Arivis 4DFusion pipelines. 

1)Viral_Particle: detects diffraction limited spots, in this case, viral particles, in confocal Z-stacks. 
2)Find: Segments cells based on membrane stains and determines "cell compartments" (cytoplasm vs membrane), imports detected viral particles from previous pipeline and quantifies the #viral particles/cell compartment. 

Data is exported as excell files.
